# odin-javascript-battleship

Github repository for the battleship project from the Odin Project's JavaScript course.

This project explored the concept of Test Driven Development. The objects were created incrementally as each piece of functionality had tests written before implementation to ensure that object and method behavior were acting as expected. This approach helped add a greater sense of structure and direction to the development process, and I will continue to use TDD on projects going forward.

A live demo can be found at: https://danielkurtsawyer.github.io/odin-javascript-battleship/

Ship placement is a bit awkward, ideally I would have users click on squares but I'm not sure how to implement that quite yet. It still works but is a bit tedious.

I hope you enjoy!
